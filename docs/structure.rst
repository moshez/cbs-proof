Structure
=========

Let :math:`f:A \to A` be a one-to-one function.
We want to understand its structure.

Let us look at the smallest equivalence relation
that contains :math:`f`. We note that :math:`f(x) R x`
for every :math:`x`. If :math:`x_0, x_1` are both
part of the non-image of :math:`f`, then they are not
equivalent.

TODO: prove it.

Let us look at equivalence classes of :math:`R`.
We note that the first property means that they are
all closed under :math:`f`, and the second one means
that they can contain at most one element in the non-image
of :math:`f`. We call a class that has one element in the 
non-image a chain.

Let :math:`E` be a chain,
we can consider :math:`f_E:E\to E` as a one-to-one
function from :math:`E` onto :math:`E - {x_0}`
if :math:`x_0` is the non-image element.
