Statement
=========

Comparing sets
--------------

If :math:`A` and :math:`B` are sets,
and :math:`f:A\to B` is a function such that
:math:`f(t) = f(s)` implies :math:`t=s`
(i.e., :math:`f` is one-to-one)
then :math:`A` is said to be "no bigger"
than :math:`B`.

If :math:`f` is onto (so that for every :math:`b`
in :math:`B` there exists :math:`a` in :math:`A`
such that :math:`f(a) = b`) then the sets are
said to be the same size.

Theorem
-------

If :math:`A` is no bigger than :math:`B`
and :math:`B` is no bigger than :math:`A`
than :math:`A` and :math:`B` are the same size.
